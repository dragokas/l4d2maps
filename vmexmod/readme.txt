BSPSource
=========

BSPSource is a map decompiler for Source engine maps, written in Java.
It decompiles .bsp map files back to .vmf files that can be loaded in Hammer, Valve's official level editor.

BSPSource is based on a reengineered version of VMEX 0.98g by Rof, which is no longer developed and lacks
support for newer Source engine games.

Visit http://ata4.info/bspsrc/ for more information.

Changelog
=========

### 1.3.11 - 23.05.2013
* Added support for newer Vindictus maps.
